        <h1>OpenBridge 5.0 beta</h1>
        <p id="p1">While version 5.0 retains the principles of the previous <br> OpenBridge releases, it brings numerous <br> enhancements to the system and a wealth of additional <br> content.</p>
        <p id="p1">We've introduced a design pattern section and a new <br> templates section. The overall readability of the system <br> has been revamped, achieving a WCAG 2.1 AA rating for <br> both dusk and day modes and a AAA rating for the <br> bright palette. The maritime instruments have been <br> entirely overhauled with a new labeling system. We <br> have also overhauled the entire automation section and <br> revamped the alert system. Additional top bar content <br> has been included, such as an improved in-command <br> system and notifications. The icon library has been <br> reorganized and significantly expanded. THe integration <br> system has been redesigned. Finally we have  added an <br> entirely new section for maritime augmented reality <br> that especially are looking to support video overlays for <br> ROC.</p>
